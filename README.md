A Car Rental System created as part of a university project.

This project was given absolutely no love by tutors. It took about a month of painstaking care to build a system that I was satisfied with presenting.

When demonstrated, features I had spent hours developing were waved away with a "I don't care, move on". I got asked to demonstrate the same functionality three times because he wasn't paying attention.

This was the same for all of the groups.

Just want you to know, tutors, just because we're students- doesn't make our hard work any easier.

Thus, I'm just going to give this out. Because if it helps one person, it would have recieved more love than it got from anyone else. And that's good enough for me.
